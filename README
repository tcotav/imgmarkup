Simple tool to 'markup' coordinates in an image that you will further work on.

The idea is basically you are going to do cool stuff over the top of an image 
and you'll use this to determine what coordinates that cool stuff will revolve
around.  Numbered pins will be dropped where click on the canvas.  The 
coordinates of that drop will be recorded in the div beneath the canvas.

Save canvas as image will save the image in a hack-ish sort of way.  It will
pop up a new window and write out the canvas data to that window.  You will
then have to right click/save as to get the image down to your file system.
